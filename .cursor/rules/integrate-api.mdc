API Integration Guidelines

When implementing a new API in the Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Model Definition
- Create a new model class in the model/ folder.
- Ensure the model properly parses both the request and response data.

2. Service Layer
- Add a corresponding service in the service/ folder to handle the API call.
- Refer to existing service implementations for consistency in structure and style.

3. UI Integration
- Identify the relevant screen in the presentation/screens/ folder.
- Analyze the screenâ€™s logic and update it to integrate the new API.
- Ensure proper state handling, error management, and UI updates based on API responses.
